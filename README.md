CATCH A COPY

Xerox or photocopying with allied services like lamination and bookbinding is an attractive
business in India. Here in this blog, we intend to explain how to start a low-cost xerox shop
business with a lamination and bookbinding business. Any individual can begin this business
with a small start-up capital investment. This business is thought of as one of the best low-cost
self-employment prospects for youth.
In the view of previous studies we have found that printing has become an indispensable part
of the entire academic life of undergraduates. However, in today's printing services, most of
them have the problem of high time cost and low efficiency. At the same time, the printer itself
cannot count and analyse the entire data and cost. Therefore the online print service system
is a more efficient measure for the above problems.
For users, the online printing service system will propose a remote printing service to
guarantee convenient services and reduce the time cost. For the printer itself, the service
system prints the same document together by analyzing the current print data, reducing
the operating time cost. Simultaneously the system will record the overview of each document,
the profile of each user, and the overall printing profile for market prediction analysis
